## Core Principles

1. **No Jargon Without Explanation**: Every technical term should have a simple explanation nearby
2. **Positive, Calm Tone**: Avoid fear-based language, use encouraging and educational tone
3. **Action-Oriented**: Buttons and CTAs should clearly state what happens next
4. **Progressive Disclosure**: Start simple, reveal complexity only when needed
5. **Empowerment**: Help users feel capable, not overwhelmed
